The proton and neutron have realivly close atomic mass, you were probly confuesed by a positron, it is the antiparticle of the elcetron and has the same properites execpt oposite charge
Ions are only formed if the atom is lost entirley, the exited state is when not all electrons are in the lowest level. Since the electron has moved up it is no longer in the lowest level making it in the exicted state
Isotopes of the same element have the same number of protons (which defines the element) but differ in the number of neutrons, resulting in different mass numbers.
Oxygen (O‚ÇÇ) consists of two oxygen atoms, while ozone (O‚ÇÉ) consists of three oxygen atoms, giving them different molecular structures. Oxygen and ozone have different chemical and physical properties. For example, ozone is a strong oxidizer and can be harmful to health in high concentrations, whereas oxygen is essential for respiration.
A compound is made up of two or more different elements that are chemically combined in fixed proportions. This distinguishes compounds from mixtures, where elements or compounds are physically combined but not chemically bonded.
Fe (Iron) is a metal and contains metallic bonds.
When a cesium (Cs) atom becomes a positive ion (Cs‚Å∫), it loses one electron, resulting in a smaller electron cloud. This loss of an electron reduces the repulsion between electrons, allowing the remaining electrons to be pulled closer to the nucleus, which causes the radius to decrease.
In the reaction ùêπ + ùêπ ‚Üí ùêπ2 , two fluorine atoms combine to form a diatomic fluorine molecule (ùêπ2). When atoms bond together, energy is typically released. This is because the atoms are moving to a lower energy state when they form a stable bond. Therefore, a bond is formed, and energy is released.
A stable valence electron configuration typically corresponds to a full outer electron shell. In the case of noble gases like radon (Rn), they have a completely filled outer shell, which gives them a stable electron configuration.
Electronegativity refers to the ability of an atom to attract and hold onto electrons when it forms a chemical bond. The higher an atom's electronegativity, the stronger its pull on bonding electrons.
NaCl (sodium chloride) is a substance (not a mixture) and is a compound with a fixed ratio of sodium (Na) to chlorine (Cl) atoms. It has constant composition and consistent properties throughout, meaning every sample of NaCl will have the same chemical composition (NaCl) and similar physical properties, such as its crystalline structure and melting point.
It is a single elemt the others are compounds
Distillation is a technique used to separate components of a mixture based on differences in their boiling points. In the case of a mixture of 2-propanol (boiling point ~82.6¬∞C) and water (boiling point 100¬∞C), the components can be separated by heating the mixture to a temperature where one component (2-propanol) vaporizes first, then condensing the vapor to collect the separated liquid.
Carbon atoms have the unique ability to form strong covalent bonds with other carbon atoms, allowing them to bond together in various structures such as chains, rings, or networks. This property is fundamental to the chemistry of organic compounds. Carbon forms a variety of molecular structures, including long carbon chains (as seen in hydrocarbons), cyclic structures (as in benzene), and extensive networks (as in diamond and graphite).
Reduction refers to the process in which an atom or ion gains electrons. This decrease in oxidation state is the defining characteristic of reduction in redox (oxidation-reduction) reactions. In contrast, oxidation is the process in which an atom or ion loses electrons.

As we move down Group 17 (the halogens) from fluorine (F) to iodine (I), there is an increase in the boiling points. This trend occurs because the molecules become larger as the atomic number increases, which leads to stronger London dispersion forces (a type of van der Waals force) between the molecules. These stronger forces require more energy to overcome, leading to higher boiling points.
Aluminum (Al) reacts with iron(III) oxide (Fe‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ) to produce aluminum oxide (Al‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ) and iron (Fe). This is a single replacement reaction because aluminum (a more reactive metal) displaces iron from iron(III) oxide, replacing iron in the compound. In a single replacement reaction, one element replaces another in a compound.
The polarity of a bond depends on the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms involved. The greater the difference, the more polar the bond. F‚ÇÇ and H‚ÇÇ: In both of these molecules, the atoms are identical (F-F and H-H), so there is no difference in electronegativity, and the bonds are nonpolar. HCl: Hydrogen (H) has an electronegativity of about 2.1, and chlorine (Cl) has an electronegativity of about 3.0. The difference in electronegativity is 0.9, creating a polar bond with a dipole moment. HBr: The electronegativity difference between hydrogen (2.1) and bromine (2.8) is 0.7, which is slightly smaller than the difference in HCl. Thus, HCl has the most polar bond due to the larger electronegativity difference between H and Cl compared to the other options.
A combustion reaction typically involves the burning of a substance (usually a hydrocarbon or alcohol) in the presence of oxygen, producing carbon dioxide and water.
In the given reaction, Iodine (I‚ÇÇ) is being reduced (gaining electrons), while chlorine (Cl‚ÇÇ) is being oxidized (losing electrons). The number of moles of electrons lost by I‚ÇÇ is given as 2.0 moles. From the reaction, we can see that for every 2 moles of I‚ÇÇ that lose electrons, 2 moles of Cl‚ÇÇ gain electrons. This is because the ratio of Cl‚ÇÇ to I‚ÇÇ in terms of electron transfer is 1:1 in the balanced equation, meaning that for every 2 moles of I‚ÇÇ losing electrons, 2 moles of Cl‚ÇÇ are gaining electrons. Therefore, the number of moles of electrons gained by Cl‚ÇÇ is 2.0 mol.
In this case, the number of significant figures is determined by the digits in the number, excluding any leading zeros. 0.020 has 2 significant figures. The leading zero is not significant, but the "2" and the "0" are significant because the trailing zero after the decimal point is counted as a significant figure.
In this equation, the mole ratio refers to the relationship between the number of moles of different substances involved in the reaction. The coefficients in front of the chemical formulas indicate the relative amounts of each substance involved. 3 moles of O‚ÇÇ are required to react with 1 mole of ethanol (C‚ÇÇH‚ÇÖOH). This reaction produces 2 moles of CO‚ÇÇ (carbon dioxide) for every 3 moles of O‚ÇÇ.
